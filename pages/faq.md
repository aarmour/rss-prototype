### Is Renaissance Charter School really going to happen?

The founding board is committed to creating a new school, serving higher grades, that delivers an innovative educational program. We will submit a charter application to the Douglas County School Board in March, 2016 for a Fall 2017 opening. The Douglas County School Board has never rejected a high quality application, and we are confident our application will be strong.

### What kind of education will Renaissance Charter School offer?

Renaissance Charter School will provide an innovative educational program that will include elements of project-based learning, problem-based learning, design thinking, service learning, and adventure education. As students engage in authentic learning projects, all students will have the opportunity to design, build, and create as they would in the real world, often taking them outside the confines of the school building and the traditional school schedule. Some have called this type of learning “Deeper Learning.” Learn more from <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/programs/education/deeper-learning">The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</a> or <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/most-likely-to-succeed-tickets-18087817148?ref=ecount">attend</a> our screening of the documentary <a href="http://mltsfilm.org/">Most Likely to Succeed</a> on September 12th. 

### Where will Renaissance Charter School be located?

No decision has been made on the location of Renaissance Charter School. Our first choice would be to lease the unoccupied land next to Renaissance Magnet School from DCSD. If leasing that land is not possible or impractical, we will look to other locations in Castle Rock before looking outside of the Castle Rock area.

### Will Renaissance Charter School continue the education my children have received at Renaissance Magnet School?

Renaissance Charter School will be a natural progression from Renaissance Magnet School. It will maintain the elementary school’s commitment to innovative expeditionary learning and its strong school culture. However, because Renaissance Charter School will include higher grades with older students, the learning will look somewhat different. Students will take more responsibility for their own learning. They will engage in more projects in the community, they will create more sophisticated projects, and their learning will be more authentic.

### What does it mean to submit an Intent to Enroll?

Submitting an intent to enroll simply means that, based on what you know about the school, you are interested in enrolling your child. Gathering “intents to enroll”  is how our charter school demonstrates a demand for the type of learning/school that we are proposing to DCSD in our charter application. That said, you are not obligated to enroll in the school, nor are you guaranteed a spot at the school.  You do not lose our place at your current or neighborhood school because you have submitted an intent to enroll for Renaissance Charter.

### What grades will Renaissance Charter School have?

Grade levels offered at Renaissance Charter will be dependent on demand. If there are enough intents to enroll, Renaissance will open to grades 7-9 in 2017 and expand one grade each year through twelfth grade.

### Why a charter school? Why not a magnet school?

Two years ago, a group of parents organized under ELOBK-12 asked the Douglas County School District to expand Renaissance Magnet School to include seventh and eighth grades. After many months of discussions, DCSD rejected the request to expand Renaissance Magnet School. The only option available now is to proceed with organizing a charter school. Although not our first choice, a charter school provides us with an opportunity to operate free from many of the bureaucratic regulations district-controlled schools have. 

### What does it mean to be a charter school?

A charter school is a public, tuition-free (although fees can be charged) school granted authority to operate under a contract, or charter, with the school board. Like other public schools, charter schools are still held accountable to state standards. The school is also held accountable to its charter in a renewal process with the school board. However, the school is governed by a board of directors chosen by parents rather than the school board.

### Will Renaissance Charter School have extracurricular programs, like sports?

As a small school there will likely be fewer opportunities for extracurricular activities than at the large schools. However, we anticipate offering sports and other activities if there is a demand from students. We will also seek opportunities to partner with other schools to allow students to play on other schools’ sports teams and participate in clubs not available at Renaissance Charter School.

### What will be the school schedule? What are the start times and end times?

Decisions about specific school schedules will be made later in the school design process, likely after a school leader is chosen. We are focused on implementing research based best practices, and we are aware of the research that shows teenagers are more focused and do better in school when it starts later. We will share that research with the parent community, rely on input from parents and educators, and will design a schedule that does its best to meet everyone’s needs.

### Will the school have an arts program?

Yes. One of our six guiding design principles is Integrated Arts. Given the school’s focus on integrating subject matter, there will likely not be a specific art class like many of us had in school. Rather, art will be integrated into nearly everything students do in their projects. Students will learn the design process, graphic design, fine arts, performing arts, and more through the integrated projects they will do.
