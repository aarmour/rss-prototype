### Think Different, Think Deeper

Sixty-five percent of students entering Kindergarten today will be working in jobs that do not even exist yet. Our schools need to prepare students to live in a very different world than we live in today.

    <h4>Preparing students</h4>
    <p>When students have access to Google, teaching students to memorize facts seems quaint and outdated. Students need to learn to think critically and creatively and to persevere to solve new problems and challenges. Renaissance Charter School will reinvent education by providing students with learning opportunities designed to encourage them to develop the skills and traits they will need in the 21st century. Renaissance will be a small school focused on creating a strong school culture where students feel safe enough to take risks and grow.</p>

    <h4>Authentic learning</h4>
    <p>Learning will be authentic and project-based, where students are engaged in problem solving and tasks that have real-world significance. As they engage in authentic learning projects, all students will have the opportunity to design, build, and create as they would in the real world, often taking them outside the confines of the school building and the traditional school schedule.</p>

    <h4>Digging deeper</h4>
    <p>These learning experiences will allow students to dig deeper, and to think and apply their learning, rather than simply memorize facts to regurgitate on a standardized test. Students will also be challenged beyond the walls of the classroom through an adventure education program. By putting kids in challenging situations together, like rock climbing, backpacking, or international travel, they will build strong relationships and learn to persevere through physical and mental challenges.</p>
